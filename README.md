# Angler
***Search for clues, feed the light and find your way out!***

Angler is a first person 3D game focused on a thriller narrative where Uniqua, shipwrecked, is on a weird island home of an enormous and strange talking lighthouse, and his only way to survive is to feed its light to get the attention of another ship. Uniqua will have to use his newfound ax and find clues to increase the light's strength, while trying to understand what’s happening in this palce and, most importantly, find his way out.

Developed during the Narrative Design Awards 2024, for the theme Nautical.
